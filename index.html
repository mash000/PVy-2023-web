                <h1>Zodiac signs</h1>
                    <p> The zodiac wheel encompasses 12 signs—beginning with Aries and ending in Pisces. This modality is presented via a sphere (or “zodiac wheel”) that is divided into twelve separate sections in the sky. Each section correlates with a zodiac sign—through which the sun, moon, and planets pass during the year. The zodiacal belt is a heavenly body that extends to 8 degrees north or south of the ecliptic.</p>

                    <p>Keep in mind that this is merely a broad explanation. The zodiacal presentation can greatly differ depending on which type of astrology used (tropical or sidereal), as well as which House system is implemented. Overall, the zodiacal sphere is used to gauge daily transits and will also dictate birth chart placements.

                <h1>Elements</h1>
                    <p> The zodiac is divided into four elements: fire, air, water, and earth. Each element is home to three signs and is paired with a complimentary element. Fire is complementary to air, as water is to earth. The signs within each element all share universal characteristics. 

                    <p>Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) are exuberant and passionate, literally blazing with heated personalities.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, the air signs (Libra, Aquarius, Gemini) are logical and detached, able to view their surroundings with social intelligence.</p>
                        
                    <p>The Earth signs (Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo) are grounded and stable, rooted in structure. 
                        
                    <p>So, the Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) are typically emotionally motivated and compassionate, gifted with an innate empathic understanding. 
                        
                    <p>Together, each element offers unique traits, but the signs within them differ in expression. It can explain why some signs have similar attributes, but no one sign is the same.</p>

                <h1>Planets</h1>
                    <p>Everyone’s fascination with astrology always begins with one simple fact—their zodiac sign. However, as you become more fluent in the language of the cosmos, you come to find that your zodiac sign is just one thin layer of who you are. Once you learn the meanings behind the many planets in astrology, things start to get *way* more interesting! In fact, these various planets might even validate certain experiences you’ve had, putting your emotions into words in a way you never could before.<br>

                        You might recognize each planet by their strange and beautiful atmospheres. You probably recognize Jupiter as a gas giant swirling with clouds of ammonia and helium. You might remember Uranus for the fact that it *literally rains diamonds* on planet Uranus. And when you think of Mercury, I bet you also think of it’s teeny-tiny size and close proximity to the sun. But beyond their distinct features on the surface, these planets have deep and complex personalities of their own. Ancient astronomers considered these planets gods or divine beings that influence our lives here on Earth. And if you’re currently a lover of astrology, you know all about the endless drama these planets start with each other!

                <h1>Houses</h1>
                    <p>For many of us, horoscopes are the gateway into greater astrological curiosity. As we begin following them, we become more familiar with — and interested in — the many moving pieces of our birth charts. <br>

                    Each planet, asteroid, or celestial point exists within a House, and that placement offers invaluable insight not just about your own personality, but also how you coexist with the world around you. Moreover, the Houses are a roadmap for understanding your past, present, and future. As the planets in the sky move across these domains, different events — both tangible and emotional — are triggered. Each house is associated with a different sign. For instance, the Seventth House of Partnership is associated with Libra energy: Libra is the sign of relationships and is all about balance, love, and fairness, so it makes sense that it corresponds with partnerships.
